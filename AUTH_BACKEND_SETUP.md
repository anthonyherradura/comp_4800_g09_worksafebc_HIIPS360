# Auth / backend setup guide

How to get the HIIPS360 API and database running on your own machine, so sign-in works when you run the app.

Everything runs **locally**. You don't need a MongoDB Atlas account or any online service. Each of us has our own database on our own laptop, so accounts you create aren't shared with the rest of the group.

## What's in the repo

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| API | `server/` | Express app on port 3001: register, sign in, sign out, "who am I" |
| Database | MongoDB on your machine | Stores users (passwords as bcrypt hashes only) and sign-in sessions |
| Front end | `src/` | Vite on port 5173. It forwards `/api` requests to the API, so you only ever open 5173 |
| Settings | `.env` (you create it) | Database address and the session secret. **Never commit it.** |

## 1. Install the prerequisites (once)

1. **Node.js 22.12 or newer.** Check with `node --version`.
2. **MongoDB Community Server 8.0.** Download the Windows `.msi` from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community. During the install:
   - Choose **Complete**.
   - Leave **Install MongoD as a Service** ticked. This makes MongoDB start by itself whenever Windows starts.
   - Installing **MongoDB Compass** (a GUI for browsing the database) is optional but handy.
3. **mongosh** (optional). It's the MongoDB command-line shell, useful for checking the database: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

## 2. Make sure MongoDB is running

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
Get-Service MongoDB
```

`Status` should be `Running`. If it says `Stopped`, you need an **administrator** PowerShell to start it. A normal window and the VS Code terminal both fail with "Access is denied". Right-click Start, choose **Terminal (Admin)**, then run:

```powershell
Set-Service MongoDB -StartupType Automatic; Start-Service MongoDB
```

You only need to do this once. After that it starts by itself whenever Windows starts.

<details>
<summary>No admin rights on your machine? Run MongoDB without the service</summary>

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\mongo-data" | Out-Null
& "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath "$env:USERPROFILE\mongo-data" --bind_ip 127.0.0.1
```

Leave that window open while you work, because closing it stops the database. Your `.env` doesn't need changing.
</details>

## 3. Create your `.env` file

From the project folder:

```powershell
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, generate a session secret and put it into `.env`:

```powershell
$s = node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
(Get-Content .env) -replace '^SESSION_SECRET=.*$', "SESSION_SECRET=$s" | Set-Content .env
```

Your `.env` should end up looking like this, with your own random secret:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/hiips360
SESSION_SECRET=3f9c...64 hex characters...
PORT=3001
```

Notes:
- **Keep `127.0.0.1`. Don't change it to `localhost`.** Node tries IPv6 first, and MongoDB on Windows only listens on IPv4, so `localhost` fails to connect.
- **Everyone uses a different secret.** Don't share yours or paste it in chat.
- `.env` is in `.gitignore`. If `git status` ever lists it, stop and ask before committing.
- `.env` starts with a dot, so VS Code may not show it in the file explorer. Open it with **Ctrl+P**, type `.env`, then press Enter.
- If VS Code shows the popup "An environment file is configured but terminal environment injection is disabled", ignore it. The API reads `.env` itself.

## 4. Run it

```powershell
npm run dev:all
```

You should see both:

```
[api] HIIPS360 API on http://localhost:3001 (MongoDB connected)
[web]   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

Open http://localhost:5173, choose **Create an account**, and you should land on the home page.

Other scripts if you need them:

| Command | Runs |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev:all` | API + front end together (normal use) |
| `npm run dev` | Front end only |
| `npm run dev:api` | API only, restarts when you edit `server/` |
| `npm run build` then `npm run preview` | Production build, needed to test the offline/PWA behaviour |

## 5. Check it worked (optional)

```powershell
mongosh hiips360 --eval "db.users.find({}, { name: 1, email: 1 }).toArray()"
```

You should see the account you just made. Each document also has a `passwordHash` starting with `$2b$`; the real password is never stored.

## Troubleshooting

| You see | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Missing SESSION_SECRET` (or `MONGODB_URI`) when the API starts | `.env` is missing or that line is empty. Redo step 3. |
| `Could not connect to MongoDB ... Is the MongoDB service running?` | Run `Get-Service MongoDB`. If it's stopped, see step 2. |
| `Access is denied` when starting the service | You're not in an administrator PowerShell. See step 2. |
| `[vite] http proxy error ... ECONNREFUSED`, or "Can't reach the HIIPS360 server" on sign-in | The API isn't running. Use `npm run dev:all`, not `npm run dev`. If you only see this in the first second after starting, the API was still connecting and you can ignore it. |
| `EADDRINUSE :3001` or `:5173` | An old dev server is still running. Close the other terminal, or change `PORT` in `.env`. |
| You're still signed in after the API was stopped | This is intentional. The app remembers the last signed-in user on the device so officers stay signed in with no signal. |

## Resetting your local data

To delete every account and session in **your own** local database:

```powershell
mongosh hiips360 --eval "db.users.deleteMany({}); db.sessions.deleteMany({})"
```
